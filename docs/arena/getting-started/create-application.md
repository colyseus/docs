## Creating a Application Deployment

Your game or application can have many app deployments which are used to separate your environments (Dev, Staging, Prod) and/or regions (US East, EU West, AP South). Each app deployment has its own dedicated resources pool and works independently for all other deployments managed by your account. 

To get started create your first app deployment...
