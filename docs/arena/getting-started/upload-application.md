# Web Interface

### Requirements

* [Created](../create-application/) an Arena application deployment.

## Upload Your Code
At the bottom left side of the Application dashboard select **Server Code** to access the integrated web IDE and Uploader. 

![Arena Application Management View](../../images/edit-server-code.jpg)

From this screen you can **CREATE**, **DELETE**, **UPLOAD** and **DEPLOY** code to your deployments game server fleet. Select **Upload** to open up the dialog, from here you can choose to upload a single file or upload a folder.

!!! NOTE
    - Arena Applications **ONLY SUPPORTS** compiled Javascript code, if you are using TypeScript be sure to BUILD your code first and upload the content of the build folder.
    - If you used the ***NPM*** template to create your Colyseus server the ``` npm run build ``` command will compile and copy all required files into your output folder.

## Server Code Overview

After completing your upload you should see the following files and folder structure if you used the ``` npm run build ``` template. 

![Arena Code Template(../../images/code-template.jpg)

- **arena.config.js:** This file is where you should add your room declarations, express add-ons and any other functions you need called before server launch. Consider this as your ***index.js*** when deploying your application to Arena Cloud.

*File ```arena.config.js``` Example:*
```
const Arena = require("@colyseus/arena").default;
const { monitor } = require("@colyseus/monitor");

/**
 * Import your Room files
 */
const { ShootingGalleryRoom } = require("./rooms/ShootingGalleryRoom");

module.exports = Arena({
    getId: () => "Your Colyseus App",

    initializeGameServer: (gameServer) => {
        /**
         * Define your room handlers:
         */
        gameServer.define('ShootingGalleryRoom', ShootingGalleryRoom);
    },

    initializeExpress: (app) => {
        /**
         * Bind your custom express routes here:
         */
        app.get("/", (req, res) => {
            res.send("It's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum!");
        });

        /**
         * Bind @colyseus/monitor
         * It is recommended to protect this route with a password.
         * Read more: https://docs.colyseus.io/tools/monitor/
         */
        app.use("/colyseus", monitor());
    },

    beforeListen: () => {
        /**
         * Before before gameServer.listen() is called.
         */
    }

});
```
- **arena.env:** In this file you will define any custom environment variables that your application requires. This would be a good file to use to store keys that separate development and production environments.

*File ```arena.env``` Example:*
```
NODE_ENV=production
ABC_GAME_MODE=dev
```

 - **index.js** This file is NOT used when hosted on Arena Cloud. This file facilitates local development hosting or self-hosting. When using Arena Cloud, your *arena.config.js* is initialized by a modified version of Colyseus Open-Source designed for enterprise grade scalability and stability.

 - **package.json** The build command on the **NPM** template copies your existing package.json into the distribution folder. This file is used to install user defined modules at the launch of the game server.

- **.npmrc** *(optional)*: If you are using a non-public NPM module and need Arena to access a private NPM repo this can be done by adding the below file to the root directory of your server code. 

*File ```.npmrc``` Example:*
```
<PROJECT/REPO NAME>:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<PRIVATE TOKEN / KEY>
```

!!! NOTE   
    - You MUST include `//` before the npm.pkg.git.com entry on the second line
    - If you are using a registry other than github update the `registry` url
    - Replace `<PROJECT/REPO NAME>` and `<PRIVATE TOKEN / KEY>` with your project values.


<!-- ### Deploy your server code

To deploy your code you will need to select the ***Deploy*** button at the top right of the Server Code page. This button will bring up the follow dialog to confirm your deployment action. Clicking deploy will copy the update server code to your game servers, without deploying you will not see your updated code reflected on the active servers even though it shows here in the Server Code section.

- **Reload Deployment:** Checking this will force the game servers to restart upon deployment. This is useful when developing to quickly update an App Deployment to test changes made to your server code. Note that this action will also boot any current player out of their current game.

!!! NOTE   
    ***Production:*** See our section on [Production Deployments](blank) on our recommended deployment patterns for handling hot patches / updates without interrupting current game sessions. -->
