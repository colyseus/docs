# Modifying an Existing Colyseus Server

If you already have a Colyseus server or initially started with a self-hosting setup, you might have a server folder structure and index file that looks like this.

### Self-hosted index.ts

## Changes required for Arena Cloud

To use Arena Cloud you will have to modifiy the above server code to work with the current **NPM** Colyseus template. Overall, these modifications are minor for existing 0.14 servers. The changes only require that you move your room definitions and custom express routes into the ```arena.config``` file. For the above example the following would be the correct way to modify the server code.

!!! NOTE
    9/14/2021 Updated: You will notice we don't require definitions drivers on Arena Cloud. This is because Arena Cloud runs all required services and databases needed to host a Colyseus Server at scale for you in the background. Because of this, you as a developer will not need define ***presence*** / ***matchmaking*** drivers or deploy & host their required databases. Transports can now be selected by the developer using Arena Cloud, see examples below.


### Modified arena.config.ts

```
import Arena from "@colyseus/arena";
import { monitor } from "@colyseus/monitor";
import { uWebSocketsTransport } from "@colyseus/uwebsockets-transport";
//import { WebSocketTransport } from  "@colyseus/ws-transport";
import { ShootingGalleryRoom } from "./rooms/ShootingGalleryRoom";
const port = Number(process.env.PORT);

export default Arena({
    getId: () => "Your Colyseus App",

    initializeGameServer: (gameServer) => {

        gameServer.define('ShootingGalleryRoom', ShootingGalleryRoom);

    },

    initializeTransport: (options) => {

        return new uWebSocketsTransport({});

        /**
         * Define your server transports as Legacy WS (legacy)
         */
        // return new WebSocketTransport({
        //     ...options,
        //     pingInterval: 5000,
        //     pingMaxRetries: 3,
        // });
    },

    initializeExpress: (app) => {

        app.get("/", (req, res) => {
            res.send("It's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum!");
        });

        app.use("/colyseus", monitor());
    },


    beforeListen: () => {
        console.log(`Listening on ws://localhost:${ port }`)
    }
});
```
