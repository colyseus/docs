- [Construct 3](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-construct3) (compatible with C3 and C2 runtime from Construct3)
- [Construct 2](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-construct2) (Not up-to-date - compatible with server 0.9.x)

## Example project

The example project has a similar result as the [TypeScript (pixijs-boilerplate)](https://github.com/endel/colyseus-pixijs-boilerplate).

- [Client-side (c3p project)](/_downloads/ColyAgarClient-0-13-1.c3p)
- [Server-side (source-code)](https://glitch.com/~held-quartz)

## Important

Construct has well-known existing features to "host" a multiplayer session from the client. This is not possible via Colyseus. Colyseus is an authoritative SERVER, written in Node.js. You can't make your client be the host of the game sessions.

## Handling messages

An important note when sending messages from the server to the clients: you need
to provide an object with a `"type"` field, in order for the client to be able
to parse it.

**Server-side**

```typescript
this.broadcast("foo", "bar");
```

**Client-side**

Use the `On Message` condition, with `"foo"` as argument. The expression `CurrentValue` will have the value `"bar"`.
