# Construct 3 SDK

## Installation

- [Download Construct 3 SDK](https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/addons/111/colyseus-multiplayer-client)

!!! Warning "Attention! You need a server to use Colyseus!"
    Construct has well-known existing features to "host" a multiplayer session from the client-side. This is not possible when using Colyseus. Colyseus is an authoritative **server**, written in Node.js. You can't let your client-side host the game sessions directly.

!!! tip "Construct 3 SDK: Source code"
    You can find the source code of the Construct SDK's here: [Construct 3](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-construct3) (compatible with C3 and C2 runtime from Construct3) / [Construct 2](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-construct2) (not up-to-date - compatible with server 0.9.x)

## Example project

Please explore this demonstration project to understand how to use Colyseus with Construct3.

- [Download `.c3p` and server files](https://github.com/colyseus/construct3-demo/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Open the `ConstructProject.c3p` file on Construct editor.
- (optional) Start the local server by running `npm install` and then `npm start`

To use your local server, make sure to replace the `serverURI` global variable with `ws://localhost:8080` from the Event Sheet on Construct.

> This project was based on the [TypeScript (pixijs-boilerplate)](https://github.com/endel/colyseus-pixijs-boilerplate).

## Handling messages

An important note when sending messages from the server to the clients: you need
to provide an object with a `"type"` field, in order for the client to be able
to parse it.

**Server-side**

```typescript
this.broadcast("foo", "bar");
```

**Client-side**

Use the `On Message` condition, with `"foo"` as argument. The expression `CurrentValue` will have the value `"bar"`.
