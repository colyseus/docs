# Server API &raquo; Match-maker API

!!! Warning "You may not need this!"
    This section is for advanced usage. You're usually good to go by using the [client-side methods](/client/client/#methods). If you think you can't achieve your goal with the client-side methods, you should consider using the ones described on this page.

The methods described below are provided by the `matchMaker` singleton, which can be imported from the `"colyseus"` package:

```typescript fct_label="TypeScript"
import { matchMaker } from "colyseus";
```

```javascript fct_label="JavaScript"
const matchMaker = require("colyseus").matchMaker;
```

## `.createRoom(roomName, options)`
Create a new room

**Parameters:**

- **`roomName`**: the identifier you defined on `gameServer.define()`.
- **`options`**: options for `onCreate`

```typescript
const room = await matchMaker.createRoom("battle", { mode: "duo" });
console.log(room);
/*
  { "roomId": "xxxxxxxxx", "processId": "yyyyyyyyy", "name": "battle", "locked": false }
*/
```

## `.joinOrCreate(roomName, options)`

Join or create a room and return a client seat reservation.

**Parameters:**

- **`roomName`**: the identifier you defined on `gameServer.define()`.
- **`options`**: options for the client seat reservation (for `onJoin`/`onAuth`)

```typescript
const reservation = await matchMaker.joinOrCreate("battle", { mode: "duo" });
console.log(reservation);
/*
  {
    "sessionId": "zzzzzzzzz",
    "room": { "roomId": "xxxxxxxxx", "processId": "yyyyyyyyy", "name": "battle", "locked": false }
  }
*/
```

!!! Tip "Consuming the seat reservation"
    You can use [`consumeSeatReservation()` from the client-side](/client/client/#consumeseatreservation-reservation) to join the room by its reserved seat.

## `.reserveSeatFor(room, options)`
Reserve a seat for a client in a room.

!!! Tip "Consuming the seat reservation"

```typescript
const rooms = await matchMaker.query({ name: "battle", mode: "duo" });

## Restricting methods to cient-side 
It is possible to restrict matchmaker method invoking for the client-side.

```typescript
import { matchmaker } from "colyseus;


matchMaker.controller.exposedMethods = ['joinOrCreate', 'create', 'join', 'joinById', 'reconnect'];
```

From the exposed method list remove the method to restrict.
