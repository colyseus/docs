# Server API &raquo; Match-maker API

!!! Warning "You may not need this!"
    This section is for advanced usage. You're usually good to go by using the [client-side methods](/client/#methods). If you think you can't achieve your goal with the client-side methods, you should consider using the ones described on this page.

The methods described below are provided by the `matchMaker` singleton, which can be imported from the `"colyseus"` package:

```typescript fct_label="TypeScript"
import { matchMaker } from "colyseus";
```

```javascript fct_label="JavaScript"
const matchMaker = require("colyseus").matchMaker;
```

## `.createRoom(roomName, options)`
Create a new room

**Parameters:**

- **`roomName`**: the identifier you defined on `gameServer.define()`.
- **`options`**: options for `onCreate`.

```typescript
const room = await matchMaker.createRoom("battle", { mode: "duo" });
console.log(room);
/*
  { "roomId": "xxxxxxxxx", "processId": "yyyyyyyyy", "name": "battle", "locked": false }
*/
```

## `.joinOrCreate(roomName, options)`

Join or create a room and return a client seat reservation.

**Parameters:**

- **`roomName`**: the identifier you defined on `gameServer.define()`.
- **`options`**: options for the client seat reservation (for `onJoin`/`onAuth`).

```typescript
const reservation = await matchMaker.joinOrCreate("battle", { mode: "duo" });
console.log(reservation);
/*
  {
    "sessionId": "zzzzzzzzz",
    "room": { "roomId": "xxxxxxxxx", "processId": "yyyyyyyyy", "name": "battle", "locked": false }
  }
*/
```

!!! Tip "Consuming the seat reservation"
    You can use [`consumeSeatReservation()` from the client-side](/client/#consumeseatreservation-reservation) to join the room by its reserved seat.

## `.reserveSeatFor(room, options)`
Reserve a seat for a client in a room.

**Parameters:**

- **`room`**: room data (result from `createRoom()`, etc).
- **`options`**: options for `onCreate`.

const reservation = await matchMaker.reserveSeatFor("battle", { mode: "duo" });
console.log(reservation);
/*
  {
    "sessionId": "zzzzzzzzz",
    "room": { "roomId": "xxxxxxxxx", "processId": "yyyyyyyyy", "name": "battle", "locked": false }
  }
*/
```

**Parameters:**

import { matchmaker } from "colyseus;

matchMaker.controller.exposedMethods = ['join', 'joinById', 'reconnect'];
```

Include only the methods which are accessible to the client-side from below methods.

- create
- join
- joinById
