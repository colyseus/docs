## `@colyseus/arena` has been renamed to `@colyseus/tools`

You can remove `@colyseus/arena` and install `@colyseus/tools`:

=== ":octicons-terminal-16: npm install"

    ``` bash
    npm install --save @colyseus/tools
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-js: `arena.config.ts`"

    ``` typescript
    // 0.14 (old)
    import Arena from "@colyseus/arena";
    export default Arena({...})

    // 0.15 (new)
    import config from "@colyseus/tools";
    export default config({...})
    ```

You can also rename the `arena.config.ts` file to `app.config.ts` for consistency.

---

## Schema's `.triggerAll()` has been deprecated

Now, whenever you register an `onAdd()` callback, it is called immediately for already existing items - thus, making the usage of `.triggerAll()` not necessary anymore.

You can prevent the `onAdd()` callback from being triggered automatically, though, if necessary.

```typescript
state.players.onAdd(() => {
    /*
     * a player has been added
     */
}, false);
```

By providing `false` in the second argument, the `onAdd()` callback is not going to be triggered for already existing items.

---

## Schema callbacks API slightly changed

Now, instead of assigning a single callback per `onAdd`/`onChange`/`onRemove`, you attach them by calling as a method instead. You can attach more than one callback this way.

See example below:

=== "TypeScript"

    ``` typescript
    // 0.14 (old)
    state.players.onAdd = function(value, key) {/* do stuff */};
    state.players.onChange = function(value, key) {/* do stuff */};
    state.players.onRemove = function(value, key) {/* do stuff */};

    // 0.15 (new)
    state.players.onAdd(function(value, key) {/* do stuff */});
    state.players.onChange(function(value, key) {/* do stuff */});
    state.players.onRemove(function(value, key) {/* do stuff */});
    ```
=== "C#"

    ``` csharp
    // 0.14 (old)
    state.players.OnAdd += (key, value) => {/* do stuff */};
    state.players.OnChange += (key, value) => {/* do stuff */};
    state.players.OnRemove += (key, value) => {/* do stuff */};

    // 0.15 (new)
    state.players.OnAdd((key, value) => {/* do stuff */})
    state.players.OnChange((key, value) => {/* do stuff */})
    state.players.OnRemove((key, value) => {/* do stuff */})
    ```

=== "Lua"

    ``` lua
    -- 0.14 (old)
    state.players.on_add = function(value, key) --[[ do stuff ]] end
    state.players.on_change = function(value, key) --[[ do stuff ]] end
    state.players.on_remove = function(value, key) --[[ do stuff ]] end

    -- 0.15 (new)
    -- ATTENTION: this is a method call. make sure to use `:` instead of `.` here.
    state.players:on_add(function(value, key) --[[ do stuff ]] end)
    state.players:on_change(function(value, key) --[[ do stuff ]] end)
    state.players:on_remove(function(value, key) --[[ do stuff ]] end)
    ```

=== "Haxe"

    ``` haxe
    // 0.14 (old)
    state.players.onAdd = function(value, key) {/* do stuff */};
    state.players.onChange = function(value, key) {/* do stuff */};
    state.players.onRemove = function(value, key) {/* do stuff */};

    // 0.15 (new)
    state.players.onAdd(function(value, key) {/* do stuff */});
    state.players.onChange(function(value, key) {/* do stuff */});
    state.players.onRemove(function(value, key) {/* do stuff */});
    ```

The return value of `onAdd()`/`onChange()`/`onRemove()` is a function that can detach the callback that have been added.

=== "TypeScript"

    ``` typescript
    const detachCallback = state.players.onAdd(function(value, key) {/* do stuff */});

    // detaches the onAdd callback.
    detachCallback();
    ```

=== "C#"

    ``` csharp
    var detachCallback = state.players.OnAdd((key, value) => {/* do stuff */})

    // detaches the onAdd callback.
    detachCallback();
    ```

=== "Lua"

    ``` lua
    local detach_callback = state.players:on_add(function(value, key) --[[ do stuff ]] end)

    -- detaches the onAdd callback.
    detach_callback();
    ```

=== "Haxe"

    ``` haxe
    var detachCallback = state.players.onAdd(function(value, key) {/* do stuff */});

    // detaches the onAdd callback.
    detachCallback();
    ```

---

## Schema's `onChange` behaviour change

Previously, the `onChange` callback wouldn't be fired during `onAdd` and `onRemove` when attached to a collection of items (`MapSchema`, `ArraySchema`, etc).

Now, `onChange` is triggered alongside with `onAdd` and `onRemove`.

---

## `MapSchema` is now strict on property accessors

Only JavaScript/TypeScript is affected. If you use a client-side SDK other than JavaScript/TypeScript, no change is needed on the client-side for you.

``` typescript
// 0.14 (old)
this.state.players[client.sessionId] = new Player();

// 0.15 (new)
this.state.players.set(client.sessionId, new Player());
```

> **Reasoning:** `MapSchema` used to be treated as a regular JavaScript object in the early days. Since version 0.14 `MapSchema` uses a real `Map` internally, with a "proxy" compatibility layer in order to avoid breaking existing projects. Now the "proxy" layer has been removed, improving the performance slightly.

---

## `client.reconnect()` API slightly changed

The previous reconnection implementation had a [security vulnerability](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/issues/354), although very unlikely to be explored, we had to update its implementation to make it secure.

``` typescript
// 0.14 (old)
client.reconnect(cachedRoomId, cachedSessionId)

// 0.15 (new)
client.reconnect(cachedReconnectionToken)
```

Insterad of providing the previously active `room.roomId` and `room.sessionId` for reconnection, you only provide the `room.reconnectionToken` instead.

Reconnection tokens are unique and private for each client.

---

## `allowReconnection()`: second argument is now mandatory

Previously, by omitting the second argument of `allowReconnection()`, you were in control over when to cancel the possibility for reconnection.

To make this intent more explicit, it is now mandatory to provide the second argument either as `"manual"`, or the number of seconds to wait for reconnection:

=== "Manual"

    ``` typescript
    async onLeave (client: Client, consented: boolean) {
    // ...
    try {
        if (consented) { throw new Error("consented leave"); }

        //
        // Get reconnection token
        // NOTE: do not use `await` here yet!
        //
        const reconnection = this.allowReconnection(client, "manual");

        //
        // here is the custom logic for rejecting the reconnection.
        // for demonstration purposes of the API, an interval is created
        // rejecting the reconnection if the player has missed 2 rounds,
        // (assuming he's playing a turn-based game)
        //
        // in a real scenario, you would store the `reconnection` in
        // your Player instance, for example, and perform this check during your
        // game loop logic
        //
        const currentRound = this.state.currentRound;
        const interval = setInterval(() => {
        if ((this.state.currentRound - currentRound) > 2) {
            // manually reject the client reconnection
            reconnection.reject();
            clearInterval(interval);
        }
        }, 1000);

        // now it's time to `await` for the reconnection
        await reconnection;

        // client returned! let's re-activate it.
        // ...

    } catch (e) {

        // reconnection has been rejected. let's remove the client.
        // ...
    }
    }
    ```

=== "Number of seconds"

    ``` typescript
    async onLeave (client: Client, consented: boolean) {
    try {
        if (consented) { throw new Error("consented leave"); }

        // allow disconnected client to reconnect into this room until 20 seconds
        await this.allowReconnection(client, 20);

    } catch (e) {

        // 20 seconds expired. reconnection not successful.
    }
    }
    ```

---

## `@colyseus/loadtest` has been reworked!

The loadtest tool has been reworked to allow for more complex scripting, so your loadtest scripts will need to be slightly rewritten, as the new format looks like this:

``` typescript
import { Client, Room } from "colyseus.js";
import { cli, Options } from "@colyseus/loadtest";

async function main(options: Options) {
    const client = new Client(options.endpoint);
    const room: Room = await client.joinOrCreate(options.roomName, {/*
        your join options here...
    */});

    console.log("joined successfully!");

    room.onMessage("message-type", (payload) => {
        // logic
    });

    room.onStateChange((state) => {
        console.log("state change:", state);
    });

    room.onLeave((code) => {
        console.log("left");
    });
}

// execute
cli(main);
```

## `@colyseus/command` typings update

On latest version of `@colyseus/command` (`0.2.0`), instead of providing the state as a generic when extending the `Command`, you now provide your whole `Room` type:

```diff
import { Command } from "@colyseus/command";
export class MyRoom extends Room<State> {/* ... */}
-export class MyCommand extends Command<State> {/* ... */}
+export class MyCommand extends Command<MyRoom> {/* ... */}
```

---

## Built-in `client.auth` is gone! `@colyseus/social` fully deprecated.

The [documentation has been discouraging the use of `@colyseus/social`](https://0-14-x.docs.colyseus.io/colyseus/tools/colyseus-social/) since version 0.14.

Now `@colyseus/social` has been officially deprecated. If you **really** rely on it please reach out to the devs on Discord on how to proceed if you still need to use it.

---

## `RedisDriver` and `RedisPresence` constructor change

Providing a URI as connection string for `RedisDriver` or `RedisPresence` has
changed to:

```diff
-new RedisDriver({ url: "redis://xyz:123" })
+new RedisDriver("redis://xyz:123")
```
