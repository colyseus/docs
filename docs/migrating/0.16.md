# Migrating to version 0.16 (from 0.15)

> Version 0.16 is still under "preview" tag and it is not stable.
> This guide is still being updated and is intended for early adopters and contributors.

Use this guide to migrate your existing 0.15 projects to version 0.16.

<!-- See [version 0.16 release announcement](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/releases/tag/0.16.0). -->

Make sure `colyseus` versions on `package.json` are pointing to `^0.16.0-preview.0`:

```json
    "@colyseus/schema": "^3.0.0-alpha.0",
    "colyseus": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
    "@colyseus/core": "^0.16.0-preview.16",
    "@colyseus/monitor": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
    "@colyseus/playground": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
    "@colyseus/tools": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
    "@colyseus/uwebsockets-transport": "^0.16.0-preview.0",
```

Make sure you don't have any packages under `0.15.x`, neither `@colyseus/schema` under `2.0.x`. You may need to remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` before running `npm install`.

## Schema callbacks and `$(instance)` proxy

As the callback methods have been extracted out of the `Schema` instances, you now have to get a proxied version of your `Schema` instances via `$(yourInstance)` in order to attach callbacks into them.

```typescript
import { getStateCallbacks } from "colyseus.js";

const room = await client.joinOrCreate("my_room");
const $ = getStateCallbacks(room);

$(room.state).players.onAdd((player, sessionId) => {
    // this is the raw Schema instance
    console.log(player);

    // this is the proxied version, where you can attach the callbacks
    $(player).listen("x", (value, previousValue) => {
        console.log("player.x has been updated!", value, previousValue);
    });
});
```

The proxy is capable of entering nested objects, even if they're not available at the time you're attaching the callback.

```typescript
$(room.state)
    .instance // this is a Schema instance (may not be immediately available)
    .items // this is a MapSchema or ArraySchema (may also not be immediately available)
    .onAdd((item, index) => {
        console.log("item added at index", index);
    });
```

## `@filter()` and `@filterChildren()` are now deprecated!

The `StateView` feature has been introduced in version 0.16, which allows you to create a view of your state with a subset of the data.

```typescript
import { view, type, Schema, MapSchema } from "@colyseus/schema";

class MyState extends Schema {
    @type({ map: Player }) players = new MapSchema<Player>();
}

class Player extends Schema {
    // this property is visible to all
    @type("string") name: string;

    // this property is only visible a `StateView` that has added this Player instance.
    @view() @type("number") position: number;
}
```

The `StateView` must be assigned to the `client.view`. The room serializer is going to use the `client.view` to serialize the state before sending it to the client.

```typescript
import { StateView } from "@colyseus/schema";

// ...
    onJoin(client, options) {
        const player = new Player();

        client.view = new StateView();
        client.view.add(player);

        this.state.players.set(client.sessionId, player);
    }
```

Each `StateView` instance is going to add a new encoding step for state serialization. You may re-use the same `StateView` instance for multiple clients, or create a new one for each client.

See more in the [`StateView` documentation](../../state/schema/#stateview).

## Sending schema-encoded messages is now deprecated

Sending schema instances as messages via `client.send(instance)` or `this.broadcast(instance)` is now deprecated. This feature it was introduced in previous versions due to lack of strong types in C# for messages.
