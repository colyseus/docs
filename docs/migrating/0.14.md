# Migrating to version 0.14.x (from 0.13.x)

As a result from [colyseus/schema#75](https://github.com/colyseus/schema/issues/75) - the Colyseus version `0.14.x` introduces a few breaking changes on the usage of `MapSchema`, and schema callbacks on the client-side, as both the Schema encoder and decoder have been reworked.

## `MapSchema` breaking changes

`MapSchema` used to be treated as a plain JavaScript object (`{}`). Now, it uses the built-in [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) under the hood. 

By using the built-in `Map`, issues regarding the order of map keys are gone ([#51](https://github.com/colyseus/schema/pull/51) and [#70](https://github.com/colyseus/schema/pull/70)).

There are a few breaking changes, which you should fix in your project, though.

### Iterating through all items

Previous version:

```typescript
for (const key in yourMap) {
    key // map key
    yourMap[key] // map value
}
```

New version:

```typescript
yourMap.forEach((value, key) => {
    key // map key
    value // map value
});
```

Alternatively, you may iterate through the map's keys, or values alone, by using the iterators [`map.keys()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/keys) or [`map.values()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/values).

### Getting the total number of items

Previous version:

```typescript
const size = Object.keys(this.state.players).length;
console.log("Number of items =>", size);
```

New version:

```typescript
const size = this.state.players.size;
console.log("Number of items =>", size);
```

### Getting the keys of a MapSchema

Previous version:

```typescript
Object.keys(map)
```

New version:

```typescript
Array.from(map.keys())
```

### Getting a typed child from `MapSchema`

**This is not a breaking change!** Even though it's recommended to use the new version, you can **still** use the previous one on this update. Next version may fully deprecate the bracket accessor in the future.

Previous version:

```typescript
const entry = yourMap['key'];
// entry is type of `any`
```

New version:

```typescript
const entry = yourMap.get('key');
// entry has the right child type
```
