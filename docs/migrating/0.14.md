# Migrating to version 0.14 (from 0.13)

As a result from [colyseus/schema#75](https://github.com/colyseus/schema/issues/75) - the Colyseus version `0.14` introduces a few breaking changes on the usage of `MapSchema`, and schema callbacks on the client-side, as both the Schema encoder and decoder have been reworked.

**Upgrading the server:**

```
npm install colyseus@^0.14.0 --save
```

**Upgrading the client:**

```
npm install colyseus.js@^0.14.0 --save
```

If you're using Unity or other client, please check on its respective repository on GitHub. If you have questions feel free to ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RY8rRS7)

## `MapSchema` breaking changes

`MapSchema` used to be treated as a plain JavaScript object (`{}`). Now, it uses the built-in [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) under the hood. 

By using the built-in `Map`, issues regarding the order of map keys are gone ([#51](https://github.com/colyseus/schema/pull/51) and [#70](https://github.com/colyseus/schema/pull/70)).

There are a few breaking changes, which you should fix in your project, though.

### Iterating through all items

Previous version:

```typescript
for (const key in yourMap) {
    key // map key
    yourMap[key] // map value
}
```

New version:

```typescript
yourMap.forEach((value, key) => {
    key // map key
    value // map value
});
```

Alternatively, you may iterate through the map's keys, or values alone, by using the iterators [`map.keys()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/keys) or [`map.values()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/values).

### Getting the total number of items

Previous version:

```typescript
const size = Object.keys(this.state.players).length;
console.log("Number of items =>", size);
```

New version:

```typescript
const size = this.state.players.size;
console.log("Number of items =>", size);
```

### Getting the keys of a MapSchema

Previous version:

```typescript
Object.keys(map)
```

New version:

```typescript
Array.from(map.keys())
```

### Getting a typed child from `MapSchema`

**This is not a breaking change!** Even though it's recommended to use the new version, you can **still** use the previous one on this update. Next version may fully deprecate the bracket accessor in the future.

Previous version:

```typescript
const entry = yourMap['key'];
// entry is type of `any`
```

New version:

```typescript
const entry = yourMap.get('key');
// entry has the right child type
```


## Client-side: Schema callbacks

TLDR: Double-check all your `onChange` callbacks in the client-side. You may need to add more `onChange` callbacks for children structures.

### `onChange` on Schema references

**Previous version**: Whenever a change happens on deeper children, the field of the parent container is triggered as a change.

```typescript
// Server-side
state.player.position.x = 10;

// Client-side
state.player.onChange = function(changes) {
    changes[0].field // "position" is here!
}
```

**New version**: Now, changes are **not propagated** to parent Schema instances anymore. If you need to listen for a change on `player.position`, you need to attach a `onChange` callback to the specific instance you're interested on.

```typescript
// Server-side
state.player.position.x = 10;

// Client-side
state.player.position.onChange = function(changes) {
    changes[0].field // "x" is here!
}
```

### `onChange` on collections (ArraySchema, MapSchema, etc.)

Similarly as on the previous example, `onChange` is not triggered anymore if the children of the collection is an Schema instance. `onChange` is only triggered for primitive values.

**Previous version**: 

```typescript
state.arrayOfSchemas.onChange = function(value, key) {
    console.log(value, "has changed at", key);
}

state.arrayOfPrimitives.onChange = function(value, key) {
    console.log(value, "has changed at", key);
}
```

**New version**:

```typescript
state.arrayOfSchemas.onAdd = function(value, key) {
    value.onChange = function(changes) {
        console.log("List of changes", changes);
    }
}

state.arrayOfSchemas.onChange = function(value, key) {
    // this is never called!
}

state.arrayOfPrimitives.onChange = function(value, key) {
    // here remains the same for primitive values (string, number, boolean)
    console.log(value, "has changed at", key);
}
```
