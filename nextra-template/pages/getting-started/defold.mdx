# {defold} Defold Engine

The Colyseus SDK for Defold supports all major platforms, including:

- HTML5,
- iOS,
- Android
- Native (Mac, and Windows.)

## Installation

From your `game.project` file, and add the following Dependencies to your project:

```txt copy
https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-defold/archive/0.16.zip
```

```txt copy
https://github.com/defold/extension-websocket/archive/master.zip
```

Now, select **Project** ▸ **Fetch Libraries** to update library dependencies, two folders with the libraries name should pop up on your Defold project. This means the libraries have been imported correctly.

<Callout type="info">

</Callout>


## Usage

```lua filename="main.lua"
local ColyseusClient = require "colyseus.client"

local client
local room

function init(self)
    -- Add initialization code here
    client = ColyseusClient.new("ws://localhost:2567")

    -- join chat room
    client:join_or_create("chat", {}, function(err, _room)
      if err then
        print("JOIN ERROR: " .. err)
        return
      end

      room = _room
    end)
end
```

See [client-side documentation](/client/).

## FAQ

### "I can't connect to the local server!"

When running on localhost, make sure you don't have any service running on port
80, otherwise the client won't connect into the specified port number.

Alternatively, you can bind the Colyseus server to port 80.

**WSL2 Users**

When running the colyseus server inside WSL2, you won't be able to use `localhost` as the hostname.
You'll need to get the WSL2 machine's IP by using `wsl hostname -I` and use that IP.

### "`reconnect()` is not working on iOS!"

If you lock your phone, all WebSocket connections will be closed. You can call `reconnect()` to reestablish the session, which needs a workaround for iOS:

```lua
function window_callback(self, event, data)
    if event == window.WINDOW_EVENT_FOCUS_GAINED then
        -- iOS workaround to re-active WebSocket connection after phone is unlocked
        room:send("whatever")
    end
end

window.set_listener(window_callback)
```
