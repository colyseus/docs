## Built-In Rooms

<Cards>
    <Cards.Card title="Lobby Room" href="/server/room/built-in/lobby" />
    <Cards.Card title="Relay Room" href="/server/room/built-in/relay" />
</Cards>

The built-in rooms are useful for simple use cases. They are implemented in a way that you can easily extend them with custom logic when you see fit.
