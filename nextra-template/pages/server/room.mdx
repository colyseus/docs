# Room API

The `Room` class is meant to implement a game session, and/or serve as the communication channel between a group of clients.

- Rooms are created **on demand** during matchmaking by default
- Room classes must be exposed using [`.define()`](/server/api/#define-roomname-string-room-room-options-any)


<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "JavaScript"]}>

## Room Lifecycle Events

- The room lifecycle events are called automatically.
- Optional [`async`/`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) is supported on every lifecycle event.

### onCreate

Called once, when the room is created by the matchmaker. `options` is the merged values specified on [Server#define()](/server/#define-room-type) with the options provided the client on [`client.join()`](/client#join-or-create-a-room).

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onCreate (options) {
    /**
     * This is a good place to initialize your room state.
     */
}
```

The server may overwrite options during [`.define()`](/server/#define-room-type) for authortity over client-provided options:

<Tabs items={["Server-side", "Client-side"]}>
    <Tabs.Tab>

        ```ts filename="app.config.ts"
        // (server-side)
        // ...
        gameServer.define("my_room", MyRoom, {
            map: "cs_assault"
        })
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
        The `options` argument is provided by the client upon room creation:

        ```js filename="client.js"
        // (client-side - using the javascript sdk)
        // ...
        client.joinOrCreate("my_room", {
            name: "Jake",
            map: "de_dust2"
        })
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

On this example, the `map` option is `"cs_assault"` during `onCreate()`, and `"de_dust2"` during `onJoin()`.

---

### onAuth

See the [Authentication](/auth) section for more details.

<Tabs items={["Instance onAuth", "Static onAuth"]}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    async onAuth (client, options, request) {
        /**
         * This is a good place to validate the client's auth token.
         */
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    static async onAuth (token, request) {
        /**
         * This is a good place to validate the client's auth token.
         */
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


---

### onJoin

Triggered when a client successfully joins the room, after a successful `onAuth`.

**Parameters:**

- `client`: The [`client`](/server/client) instance.
- `options`: merged values specified on [Server#define()](/server/api/#define-roomname-string-room-room-options-any) with the options provided the client on [`client.join()`](/client/#join-roomname-string-options-any)
- `auth`: (optional) auth data returned by [`onAuth`](#onauth-client-options-request) method.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
async onJoin (client, options, auth?) {
    /**
     * This is a good place to add the client to the state.
     */
}
```

---

### onLeave

Triggered when a client leaves the room. If the disconnection was [initiated by the client](/client/client/#leave-consented-boolean), the `consented` parameter will be `true`, otherwise, it will be `false`.

```ts filename="MyRoom.s"
async onLeave (client, consented) {
    /**
     * This is a good place to remove the client from the state.
     */
}
```

You may define this function as `async`:

<Tabs items={["Synchronous", "Asynchronous"]}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    ``` typescript
    onLeave(client, consented) {
        if (this.state.players.has(client.sessionId)) {
            this.state.players.delete(client.sessionId);
        }
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
    ``` typescript
    async onLeave(client, consented) {
        const player = this.state.players.get(client.sessionId);
        await persistUserOnDatabase(player);
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
    At [Graceful Shutdown](/server/graceful-shutdown), `onLeave` is called with `consented` set to `true` for all clients.
</Callout>

---

### onDispose

The `onDispose()` method is called before the room is destroyed, which happens when:

- there are no more clients left in the room, and `autoDispose` is set to `true` (default)
- you manually call [`.disconnect()`](#disconnect).

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
async onDispose() {
    /**
     * This is a good place to perform cleanup tasks.
     */
}
```

You may define `async onDispose()` an asynchronous method in order to persist some data in the database. In fact, this is a great place to persist player's data in the database after a game match ends.

<Callout type="info">
    At [Graceful Shutdown](/server/graceful-shutdown), `onDispose` is called for all rooms.
</Callout>

---

### onUnhandledException

Opt-in to catch unhandled exceptions in your room. This method is called when an unhandled exception occurs in any of the lifecycle methods.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onUncaughtException (err: Error, methodName: string) {
    console.error("An error ocurred in", methodName, ":", err);
    err.cause // original unhandled error
    err.message // original error message
}
```

<Callout type="info">
    See [Exception Handling](/server/exception-handling) for more details.
</Callout>

---

### onBeforePatch

The `onBeforePatch` lifecycle hook is triggered before state synchronization, at patch rate frequency. (see [setPatchRate()](#setpatchrate-milliseconds))

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onBeforePatch() {
    /*
     * Here you can mutate something in the state just before it is encoded &
     * synchronized with all clients
     */
}
```

---

### onCacheRoom (`devMode`)

An optional hook to cache external data when [`devMode`](devmode) is enabled.
(See [restoring data outside the room's state](devmode/#restoring-data-outside-the-rooms-state))

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
export class MyRoom extends Room<MyRoomState> {
  // ...

  onCacheRoom() {
    return { foo: "bar" };
  }
}
```

---

### onRestoreRoom (`devMode`)

An optional hook to reprocess/restore data which was returned and stored from the previous hook [`onCacheRoom`](/server/room/#oncacheroom-any) when [`devMode`](devmode) is enabled.
(See [restoring data outside the room's state](devmode/#restoring-data-outside-the-rooms-state))

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
export class MyRoom extends Room<MyRoomState> {
  // ...

  onRestoreRoom(cachedData: any): void {
    console.log("ROOM HAS BEEN RESTORED!", cachedData);

    this.state.players.forEach(player => {
      player.method(cachedData["foo"]);
    });
  }
}
```

---

### onBeforeShutdown

The `onBeforeShutdown` lifecycle hook is called as part of the [Graceful Shutdown](/server/graceful-shutdown/) process. The process will only truly shutdown after all rooms have been disposed.

By default, the room will disconnect all clients and dispose itself immediately.

You may customize how the room should behave during the shutdown process:

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onBeforeShutdown() {
    //
    // Notify users that process is shutting down, they may need to save their progress and join a new room
    //
    this.broadcast("going-down", "Server is shutting down. Please save your progress and join a new room.");

    //
    // Disconnect all clients after 5 minutes
    //
    this.clock.setTimeout(() => this.disconnect(), 5 * 60 * 1000);
}
```

<Callout type="info">
    See [graceful shutdown](/server/graceful-shutdown) for more details.
</Callout>

---

## Public methods

Room handlers have these methods available.

### onMessage

Register a callback to process a type of message sent by the client-side.

```ts filename="Signature"
this.onMessage (type, callback)
```

- The `type` argument can be either `string` or `number`.
- You can only define a single callback per message type. (Defining a callback more than once will result in overriding the previous one)

**Callback for specific type of message**

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onCreate () {
    this.onMessage("action", (client, message) => {
        console.log(client.sessionId, "sent 'action' message: ", message);
    });
}
```

**Fallback for ALL messages**

You can register a single callback as a fallback to handle **other** types of messages.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onCreate () {
    this.onMessage("action", (client, message) => {
        //
        // Triggers when 'action' message is sent.
        //
    });

    this.onMessage("*", (client, type, message) => {
        //
        // Triggers when any other type of message is sent,
        // excluding "action", which has its own specific handler defined above.
        //
        console.log(client.sessionId, "sent", type, message);
    });
}
```

<Callout type="info">
    Use `room.send()` from the client SDK to send messages
</Callout>

---

### `setState (schema)`

Set the synchronizable room state. See [State Synchronization](/state/) and [Schema](/state/schema/) for more details.

<Callout type="info">
    You usually call this method only once during [`onCreate()`](#onCreate-options)
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    Do not call `.setState()` for every update in the room state. The binary patch algorithm is reset at every call.
</Callout>

---

### Set Simulation Interval

_Optional:_ Set a simulation interval that can change the state of the game. The simulation interval is your game loop. Default simulation interval: 16.6ms (60fps)

```ts filename="Signature"
this.setSimulationInterval (callback[, milliseconds=16.6])
```

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onCreate () {
    this.setSimulationInterval((deltaTime) => this.update(deltaTime));
}

update (deltaTime) {
    // implement your physics or world updates here!
    // this is a good place to update the room state
}
```

---

### Set Patch Rate

Set frequency the patched state should be sent to all clients. Default is `50ms` (20fps)

```ts filename="Signature"
this.setPatchRate (milliseconds)
```

---


### Set Private

Set the room listing as private - or revert it to public, if `false` is provided.

```ts filename="Signature"
this.setPrivate (bool)
```

Private Rooms are not listed during [`getAvailableRooms()`](/client/#getavailablerooms-roomname-string) method.

---

### Set Metadata

Set metadata to this room. Each room instance may have metadata attached to it - the only purpose for attaching metadata is to differentiate one room from another when getting the list of available rooms from the client-side, to connect to it by its `roomId`, using [`client.getAvailableRooms()`](/client#get-available-rooms).

```ts filename="Signature"
this.setMetadata (metadata)
```

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onCreate(options) {
    this.setMetadata({ friendlyFire: options.friendlyFire });
}
```

Now that a room has metadata attached to it, the client-side can check which room has `friendlyFire`, for example, and connect directly to it via its `roomId`:

```js filename="client.js"
// client-side
client.getAvailableRooms("battle").then(rooms => {
  for (var i=0; i<rooms.length; i++) {
    if (room.metadata?.friendlyFire) {
      //
      // join the room with `friendlyFire` by id:
      //
      var room = client.join(room.roomId);
      return;
    }
  }
});
```

<Callout type="info">
    [See how to call `getAvailableRooms()` in other languages.](/client/#getavailablerooms-roomname)
</Callout>

---

### Set Seat Reservation Time

Set the number of seconds a room can wait for a client to effectively join the room. You should consider how long your [`onAuth()`](#onauth-client-options-request) will have to wait for setting a different seat reservation time. The default value is 15 seconds.

```ts filename="Signature"
this.setSeatReservationTime (seconds)
```

You may set the `COLYSEUS_SEAT_RESERVATION_TIME` environment variable if you'd like to change the seat reservation time globally.

---

### Broadcast Message

Send a message to all connected clients.

```ts filename="Signature"
this.broadcast (type, message, options?)
```

Available options are:

- **`except`**: a [`Client`](/server/client/), or array of `Client` instances not to send the message to
- **`afterNextPatch`**: waits until next patch to broadcast the message

<Tabs items={["Broadcast to all", "Broadcast except for sender", "Broadcast after state patch"]}>

    <Tabs.Tab>
    Broadcasting a message to all clients:

    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    onCreate() {
        this.onMessage("action", (client, message) => {
            // broadcast a message to all clients
            this.broadcast("action-taken", "an action has been taken!");
        });
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
    Broadcasting a message to all clients, except the sender.

    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    onCreate() {
        this.onMessage("fire", (client, message) => {
            // sends "fire" event to every client, except the one who triggered it.
            this.broadcast("fire", message, { except: client });
        });
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
    Broadcasting a message to all clients, only after a change in the state has been applied:

    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    onCreate() {
        this.onMessage("destroy", (client, message) => {
            // perform changes in your state!
            this.state.destroySomething();

            // this message will arrive only after new state has been applied
            this.broadcast("destroy", "something has been destroyed", { afterNextPatch: true });
        });
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
    The client will receive the message in the [`onMessage()`](/client/#onmessage) callback.
</Callout>

---

### Lock Room

Locking the room will remove it from the pool of available rooms for new clients to connect to.

```ts filename="Signature"
this.lock ()
```

---

### Unlock Room

Unlocking the room returns it to the pool of available rooms for new clients to connect to.

```ts filename="Signature"
this.unlock ()
```

---

### Allow Reconnection

Allow the specified client to [`reconnect`](/client/#reconnect-reconnectiontoken) into the room. Must be used inside [`onLeave()`](#onleave-client) method.

```ts filename="Signature"
this.allowReconnection (client, seconds)
```

- **`client`**: the disconnecting [`Client`](/server/client/) instance
- **`seconds`**: number of seconds to wait for client to perform [`.reconnect()`](/client/#reconnect-roomid-string-sessionid-string), or `"manual"`, to allow for manual reconnection rejection (see second example)

**Return type:**

- `allowReconnection()` returns a `Deferred<Client>` instance.
- The returned `Deferred` instance is a promise-like structure, you can forcibly reject the reconnection by calling `.reject()` on it. (see second example)
- `Deferred` type can forcibly reject the promise by calling `.reject()` (see second example)

<Tabs items={["Reject reconnection after timeout", "Manual rejection"]}>

    <Tabs.Tab>
    **Example:** Rejecting the reconnection after a 20 second timeout.

    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    async onLeave (client: Client, consented: boolean) {
    // flag client as inactive for other users
    this.state.players.get(client.sessionId).connected = false;

    try {
        if (consented) {
            throw new Error("consented leave");
        }

        // allow disconnected client to reconnect into this room until 20 seconds
        await this.allowReconnection(client, 20);

        // client returned! let's re-activate it.
        this.state.players.get(client.sessionId).connected = true;

    } catch (e) {

        // 20 seconds expired. let's remove the client.
        this.state.players.delete(client.sessionId);
    }
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
    **Example:**  Manually rejecting the reconnection using custom logic.

    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    async onLeave (client: Client, consented: boolean) {
    // flag client as inactive for other users
    this.state.players.get(client.sessionId).connected = false;

    try {
        if (consented) {
            throw new Error("consented leave");
        }

        //
        // Get reconnection token
        // NOTE: do not use `await` here yet
        //
        const reconnection = this.allowReconnection(client, "manual");

        //
        // here is the custom logic for rejecting the reconnection.
        // for demonstration purposes of the API, an interval is created
        // rejecting the reconnection if the player has missed 2 rounds,
        // (assuming he's playing a turn-based game)
        //
        // in a real scenario, you would store the `reconnection` in
        // your Player instance, for example, and perform this check during your
        // game loop logic
        //
        const currentRound = this.state.currentRound;
        const interval = this.clock.setInterval(() => {
        if ((this.state.currentRound - currentRound) > 2) {
            // manually reject the client reconnection
            reconnection.reject();
            interval.clear();
        }
        }, 1000);

        // now it's time to `await` for the reconnection
        await reconnection;

        // clear the interval after successful reconnection.
        // not doing so may lead to dangling intervals.
        interval.clear();

        // client returned! let's re-activate it.
        this.state.players.get(client.sessionId).connected = true;

    } catch (e) {

        // reconnection has been rejected. let's remove the client.
        this.state.players.delete(client.sessionId);
    }
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### Disconnect

Disconnect all clients, then dispose.

```ts filename="Signature"
this.disconnect ()
```

---

### Broadcast Patch

<Callout type="warning">
    **You may not need this!** - This method is called automatically by the framework.
</Callout>

This method will check whether mutations have occurred in the `state`, and broadcast them to all connected clients.

```ts filename="Signature"
this.broadcastPatch ()
```

If you'd like to have control over when to broadcast patches, you can do this by disabling the default patch interval:

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onCreate() {
    // disable automatic patches
    this.setPatchRate(null);

    // ensure clock timers are enabled
    this.setSimulationInterval(() => {/* */});

    this.clock.setInterval(() => {
        // only broadcast patches if your custom conditions are met.
        if (yourCondition) {
            this.broadcastPatch();
        }
    }, 2000);
}
```

---

## Public properties

### `roomId`

A unique, auto-generated, 9-character-long identifier of the room.

You may replace `this.roomId` during `onCreate()`.

<Callout type="info">
    **Using a custom `roomId`**

    Check out the guide [How-to &raquo; Customize room id](/community/custom-room-id/)
</Callout>

---

### `roomName`

The name of the room you provided as first argument for [`gameServer.define()`](/server/api/#define-roomname-string-room-room-options-any).

---

### `state`

The synchronized state of the room.

<Callout type="info">
    See [State Synchronization](/state/).
</Callout>

---

### `clients`

The array of connected clients. See [Client instance](#client).

#### Sending a message to a specific clients.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
// ...
this.clients.forEach((client) => {
    if (client.userData.team === "red") {
        client.send("hello", "world");
    }
});
// ...
```

#### Getting a client by `sessionId`.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
// ...
const client = this.clients.getById("UEsBFUBhK");
// ...
```

---

### `maxClients`

Maximum number of clients allowed to connect into the room. When room reaches
this limit, it is locked automatically. Unless the room was explicitly locked by
you via [lock()](#lock) method, the room will be unlocked as soon as a client
disconnects from it.

---

### `patchRate`

Frequency to send the room state to connected clients, in milliseconds. Default is `50`ms (20fps)

---

### `autoDispose`

Automatically dispose the room when last client disconnects. Default is `true`

---

### `locked` (read-only)

This property will change on these situations:

- The maximum number of allowed clients has been reached (`maxClients`)
- You manually locked, or unlocked the room using [`lock()`](#lock) or [`unlock()`](#unlock).

---

### `clock`

It is recommended to use the `clock` instance for `setTimeout` and `setInterval` methods, as timers and intervals are automatically cleared when the room is disposed - preventing memory leaks.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
// ...
onCreate() {
    this.clock.setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("This message will be printed after 5 seconds");
    }, 5000);

    this.clock.setInterval(() => {
        console.log("Current time:", this.clock.currentTime);
    }, 1000);
}
// ...
```

<Callout type="info">
    See [Timing Events](/server/room/timing-events).
</Callout>

---

### `presence`

The `presence` is used as a shared in-memory database for your cluster, and for pub/sub operations between rooms.

You may access the global `presence` instance from your Room code.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
// ...
onCreate() {
    // publish an event to all rooms listening to "event-from-another-room"
    this.presence.publish("event-name-from-another-room", { hello: "world" });

    // subscribe to events from another room
    this.presence.subscribe("event-name-from-another-room", (payload) => {
        console.log("Received event from another room!", payload);
    });

    // set arbitrary value to the presence
    this.presence.set("arbitrary-key", "value");
}
// ...
```

<Callout type="info">
    See [Presence API](/server/presence).
</Callout>

---

## Client

The `client` instance from the server-side is responsible for the **transport** layer between the server and the client. It should not be confused with the [`Client` from the client-side SDK](/client/), as they have completely different purposes.

You operate on `client` instances from [`this.clients`](#clients-client), [`Room#onJoin()`](#onjoin-client-options-auth), [`Room#onLeave()`](#onleave-client-consented) and [`Room#onMessage()`](#onmessage-type-callback).

### Properties

#### `sessionId`

Unique identifier of the client connection.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
// ...
onJoin(client, options) {
    console.log(client.sessionId);
}
// ...
```

<Callout type="info">
    In the client-side, you can find the [`sessionId` in the `room` instance](/client/#sessionid-string).
</Callout>

---

#### `userData`

The `client.userData` can be used to store player-specific data easily accessible via the `client` instance. This property is meant for convenience.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
// ...
onJoin(client, options) {
  client.userData = { team: (this.clients.length % 2 === 0) ? "red" : "blue" };
}
onLeave(client)  {
  console.log(client.userData.playerNumber);
}
// ...
```

---

#### `auth`

The `client.auth` property holds the data returned by the [`onAuth()`](#onauth-client-options-request) method.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
onAuth(token, request) {
    return { userId: "123" };
}

onJoin(client, options) {
    console.log(client.auth.userId);
}
```

<Callout type="info">
    See [Authentication](/auth) for more details.
</Callout>

### Methods

#### Send Message

Send a type of message to the client. Messages are encoded with MsgPack and can hold any JSON-seriazeable data structure.

```ts filename="Signature"
client.send(type, message)
```

The `type` can be either a `string` or a `number`.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
//
// sending message with a string type ("powerup")
//
client.send("powerup", { kind: "ammo" });

//
// sending message with a number type (1)
//
client.send(1, { kind: "ammo"});
```

<Callout type="info">
    [See how to handle `onMessage` from the client-side SDK](/client/#onmessage)
</Callout>

---

#### Send Message (in bytes)

Send a raw byte array message to the client.

```ts filename="Signature"
client.sendBytes(type, bytes)
```

The `type` can be either a `string` or a `number`.

This is useful if you'd like to manually encode a message, rather than the default encoding (MsgPack).

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
//
// sending message with a string type ("powerup")
//
client.sendBytes("powerup", [ 172, 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33 ]);

//
// sending message with a number type (1)
//
client.sendBytes(1, [ 172, 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33 ]);
```

---

#### Send Error

Send an error with code and message to the client. The client can handle it on [`onError`](/client/room/#onerror)

```ts filename="Signature"
client.error(code, message)
```

---

#### Leave Room

Force disconnection of the `client` with the room. You may send a custom `code` when closing the connection, with values betweeen `4000` and `4999` (see [table of WebSocket close codes](#websocket-close-codes-table))

```ts filename="Signature"
client.leave(code?: number)
```

<Callout type="info">
    This will trigger [`room.onLeave`](/client/#onleave) event on the client-side.
</Callout>
