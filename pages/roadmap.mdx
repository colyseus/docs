# Colyseus v1.0 Roadmap

Colyseus is an independent open-source project that has been around since 2015. The project has been used in production by several indies and companies and has been battle-tested in many different scenarios. The project is currently stable, but there are still many features and improvements that we'd like to add.

<Callout type="info">
    If you'd like to support the project, please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/endel) my work.
</Callout>

- **Release the [Native SDK](https://github.com/colyseus/native-sdk)**:
    - Shared native cross-platform SDK aimed to be used on Godot ([wip](https://github.com/colyseus/native-sdk/pull/3)), Game Maker ([wip](https://github.com/colyseus/native-sdk/pull/5)), Unreal, etc.
- **Database-first features:**
    - Since Colyseus doesn't currently have an official database recommendation tool, we can't provide database-first features out of the box. Features that depend on a database tool are: player identity, leaderboards, configs, etc.
- **State Sync:**
    - **`@colyseus/schema` - Bidirectional schema instances:**
        - Allow to send schema instance updates from client to server
        - **Client-side prediction:**
            - Allow to specify client-side prediction techniques on the frontend (?)
        - **Decouple `@colyseus/schema` from the core:**
            - Allow to use other serialization methods for the state:
            - Yjs (CRDT) [connection provider](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider) via Colyseus Rooms.
        - Wild idea: support RPC calls via schema instances (?)
- **WebTransport:**
    - Improve and stabilize [WebTransport](/server/transport/webtransport) support
- **Matchmaking:**
    - Improve filtering and sorting options
- **General improvements:**
    - Add request/response model to rooms ([#331](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/issues/331))
    - Introduce the concept of "low priority" and "high priority" messages. Drop "low priority" messages if clients are under backpressure.
    - Introduce "version check" to allow native SDKs to communicate with newer versions of the server

## Shippped in v0.17 (February 2026)

- **Matchmaking:**
    - ~SQL Driver - Provide a SQL driver as alternative to `@colyseus/redis-driver` _(should support SQLite / PostgreSQL, possibly on top of Kysely)_~
        - Added [PostgreSQL Driver](/server/driver#postgresql)
    - ~**New "queue" matchmaking type:**~
        - ~A queue would keep more clients than needed before starting a match~
        - ~User specifies logic that combines clients into a new room~
        - ~Reserve seats for selected clients and redirect them to the newly created room~
        - Added [Queue matchmaking type](/server/matchmaking/queue)
- **Full-stack + TypeScript Improvements:**
    - ~Allow to specify `client.auth` and `client.userData` types on the backend only once~
    - ~Allow to infer types for room message and payload definitions from frontend _(`room.send()`)_~
    - ~Allow to infer http routes and request/response body types from frontend _(`client.http.*`)_~
