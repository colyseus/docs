# Roadmap towards Colyseus v1.0

Colyseus is an independent open-source project that has been around since 2015. The project has been used in production by several indies and companies and has been battle-tested in many different scenarios. The project is currently stable, but there are still many features and improvements that we'd like to add.

<Callout type="info">
    If you'd like to support the project, please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/endel) my work.
</Callout>

- **General improvements:**
    - Add request/response model to rooms ([#331](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/issues/331))
    - Introduce the concept of "low priority" and "high priority" messages. Drop "low priority" messages if clients are under backpressure.
    - Introduce "version check" to allow native SDKs to communicate with newer versions of the server
- **Database:**
    - Introduce an official database recommendation tool. The recommendation should be used on the documentation, official examples, and initial template project. (See [<DatabaseIcon/> Database](/database))
- **Matchmaking:**
    - SQL Driver - Provide a SQL driver as alternative to `@colyseus/redis-driver` _(should support SQLite / PostgreSQL, possibly on top of Kysely)_
    - Improve filtering and sorting options
    - **New "queue" matchmaking type:**
        - A queue would keep more clients than needed before starting a match
        - User specifies logic that combines clients into a new room
        - Reserve seats for selected clients and redirect them to the newly created room
- **State Sync:**
    - **`@colyseus/schema` - Bidirectional schema instances:**
        - Allow to send schema instance updates from client to server
        - Wild idea: support RPC calls via schema instances (?)
        - **Client-side prediction:**
            - Allow to specify client-side prediction techniques on the client-side (?)
        - **Decouple `@colyseus/schema` from the core:**
            - Allow to use other serialization methods for the state
            - Yjs (CRDT) [connection provider](https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider) via Colyseus Rooms.
- **Full-stack + TypeScript Improvements:**
    - Allow to specify `client.auth` and `client.userData` types on the server-side only once
    - Allow to infer types for room message and payload definitions from client-side _(`room.send()`)_
    - Allow to infer http routes and request/response body types from client-side _(`client.http.*`)_
- **WebTransport:**
    - Improve and stabilize [WebTransport](/server/transport/webtransport) support
- **More SDKs:**
    - Fork and support a Godot SDK _([gsioteam/godot-colyseus](https://github.com/gsioteam/godot-colyseus))_
