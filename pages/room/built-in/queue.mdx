# Queue Room

The built-in `QueueRoom` provides a matchmaking queue that groups players over time and spawns a match room when a group is ready.

**Features:**
- Rank-based grouping with customizable compatibility (`compare`).
- Team-aware grouping (`maxTeamSize`, `teamId`).
- Timeout-based priority escalation (`maxWaitingCyclesForPriority`).
- Optional incomplete matches for bots (`allowIncompleteGroups`).
- Custom room creation hook (`onGroupReady`).

<Callout type="info">
		The source-code for `QueueRoom` is available [here](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/blob/master/packages/core/src/rooms/QueueRoom.ts). You can extend it or override `compare`/`onGroupReady` for custom matchmaking.

## Server

<Steps>
### Expose the queue room

```ts {5-10} filename="server.ts"
import { defineServer, defineRoom, QueueRoom } from "colyseus";

const server = defineServer({
	rooms: {
		queue: defineRoom(QueueRoom, {
			matchRoomName: "battle",
			maxPlayers: 4,
			maxWaitingCycles: 15,
			maxWaitingCyclesForPriority: 10,
		}),
	}
});
```

### Expose your match room

```ts {7} filename="server.ts"
import { defineServer, defineRoom, Room } from "colyseus";

class BattleRoom extends Room {}

const server = defineServer({
	rooms: {
		battle: defineRoom(BattleRoom),
		queue: defineRoom(QueueRoom, { matchRoomName: "battle" })
	}
});
```
</Steps>

## Options

`QueueRoom` receives the following options on `defineRoom(QueueRoom, options)`:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `matchRoomName` | `string` | **required** | Name of the room to create when a group is ready. |
| `maxPlayers` | `number` | `4` | Number of players per match group. |
| `maxWaitingCycles` | `number` | `15` | Cycles after which a group can be marked ready if `allowIncompleteGroups` is true. |
| `maxWaitingCyclesForPriority` | `number` | `10` | Cycles after which a client becomes high-priority and can bypass `compare`. |
| `maxTeamSize` | `number` | — | Enables team-based grouping and limits team size per match. |
| `allowIncompleteGroups` | `boolean` | `false` | Allows groups to start before reaching `maxPlayers` (expect bots). |
| `compare` | `(client, group) => boolean` | built-in | Compatibility check for assigning a client to a group. |
| `onGroupReady` | `(group) => Promise<IRoomCache>` | built-in | Custom hook to create/choose the room to join. |

## Client

### Joining the queue

```ts filename="client.ts"
import { Client } from "@colyseus/sdk";

const client = new Client("http://localhost:2567");

const queue = await client.joinOrCreate("queue", {
	rank: 1200,
	teamId: "party-42",
	mode: "ranked",
});
```

### Queue updates

The server periodically notifies clients with the number of players currently in their group.

```ts filename="client.ts"
queue.onMessage("clients", (count) => {
	console.log("Players in your group:", count);
});
```

### Receiving a seat reservation

When a group is ready, the queue sends a seat reservation for the target match room:

```ts filename="client.ts"
queue.onMessage("seat", async (reservation) => {
	// Optionally confirm the reservation to the queue
	queue.send("confirm");

	// Join the match room with the reservation
	const match = await client.consumeSeatReservation(reservation);
	console.log("Joined match", match.roomId);
});
```

## Matching behavior

### Rank-based grouping

By default, clients are grouped by rank and split into multiple groups if the rank difference becomes too high. You can customize this logic with `compare`:

```ts filename="server.ts"
import { defineRoom, QueueRoom } from "colyseus";

defineRoom(QueueRoom, {
	matchRoomName: "battle",
	compare: (client, group) => {
		const diff = Math.abs(client.rank - group.averageRank);
		return diff <= 50; // strict rank matching
	}
});
```

### Team-based grouping

Provide `maxTeamSize` and pass `teamId` from the client to enforce team cohesion:

```ts filename="server.ts"
defineRoom(QueueRoom, {
	matchRoomName: "battle",
	maxPlayers: 6,
	maxTeamSize: 3,
});
```

```ts filename="client.ts"
await client.joinOrCreate("queue", {
	rank: 980,
	teamId: "party-7",
});
```

### Incomplete groups and bots

If you want matches to start even when groups are not full, enable `allowIncompleteGroups`. Your match room should fill the remaining slots with bots.

```ts filename="server.ts"
defineRoom(QueueRoom, {
	matchRoomName: "battle",
	maxPlayers: 4,
	allowIncompleteGroups: true,
	maxWaitingCycles: 8,
});
```

## Custom room creation

Use `onGroupReady` to decide how and where a match room is created:

```ts filename="server.ts"
import { defineRoom, QueueRoom, matchMaker } from "colyseus";

defineRoom(QueueRoom, {
	matchRoomName: "battle",
	onGroupReady: async function (group) {
		// Create a new room with match options
		return await matchMaker.createRoom("battle", {
			averageRank: group.averageRank,
			players: group.clients.length,
		});
	}
});
```
