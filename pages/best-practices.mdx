- Keep your room classes as small as possible, delegating game-specific functionality to other composable structures.
- Keep your synchronizeable data structures as small as possible
    - Ideally, each class extending `Schema` should only have field definitions.
    - Do not implement _heavy_ game logic inside `Schema` structures. _Some_ logic is fine, specially if they're self-contained within the scope of the structure itself, mutating only its own properties.
- Rooms should have as little code as possible, and forward actions to other structures
- Your game logic may be handled by specialized structures, such as external functions, the [Command Pattern →](/recommendations/command-pattern), or an [Entity-Component System →](/tools/3rd-party-packages#entity-component-system-ecs).
