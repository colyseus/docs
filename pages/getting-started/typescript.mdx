### Adding the TypeScript SDK to your project

This is the preffered method if you're using a build tool (`vite`, `webpack`, `rollup`, or similar)

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save colyseus.js
```

### Room's `.state` type safety and auto-completion

The TypeScript SDK provides type safety and auto-completion for your state structures. There are two ways to enable this feature:

#### 1. **Recommended:** import only the type directly from the server code:

You may use `import type` to import only the type of the state from your server code.

```ts {2,6-10}
import { Client } from "colyseus.js";
import type { MyState } from "../server/path/MyState";

const client = new Client("http://localhost:2567");

client.joinOrCreate<MyState>(...)
client.create<MyState>(...)
client.join<MyState>(...)
client.joinById<MyState>(...)
client.reconnect<MyState>(...)
```

#### 2. Providing the concrete class reference:

In some cases, you may want to import the concrete implementation, to be able to re-use methods implemented in the server in the client.

```ts
import { MyState } from "../server/path/MyState"

client.joinOrCreate("my_room", {}, MyState);
```
