### Adding the JavaScript SDK to your project

This is the preffered method if you're using a build tool (`vite`, `webpack`, `rollup`, or similar)

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save colyseus.js
```

If you're not using a build tool, it is recommended to download the release binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus.js/releases)

```html
<script src="colyseus.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you may include the distribution file directly by using unpkg. Make sure to replace the `@x.x.x` portion of it with a version compatible with your server.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/colyseus.js@^0.16.0/dist/colyseus.js"></script>
```
