# {discord} Discord Activity

<Callout type="info">
    Check out the [Discord Activity Examples](/examples/discord) to see how to use the Discord Activity SDK with Colyseus.

This Project Template is a starting point for crafting HTML5 multiplayer Discord Activities.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the front-end and back-end are separated into two different modules.

- `apps/client/` - Has the frontend project, using Pixi.js and Vite
- `apps/server/` - Has the backend project, using Colyseus (Node.js)

## Environment variables

Both the `client` and `server` projects need environment variables configured from your Discord Activity.

- `apps/client/.env` - Should contain your "OAuth2 → Client ID" under `VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`.
- `apps/server/.env` - Should contain your "OAuth2 → Client ID" under `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and "OAuth2 → Client Secret" under `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`.

## Testing your local Discord Activity

In order to test your Discord Activity locally, you need to expose your local server to the public internet.

We will need to open 3 terminal windows to run the server, client, and the `cloudflared` tunnel.

1. Start the server

```
npm run start:server
```

2. Start the client

```
npm run start:client
```

3. Use `cloudflared` or `ngrok` for exposing your local server to a public URL _([see complete tutorial here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity#step-4-running-your-app-in-discord))._

During development, there's no need to expose the `server` to the public internet - only the `client`. Our Vite development server proxies the `/colyseus` requests to our local server.

```
npm run cloudflared
```

You will need to update your Discord Activity's "OAuth2 → Redirect URL" and "URL Mappings → Target" to the URL provided by `cloudflared`:

  <img src="settings-oauth.png" width="49%" />
  <img src="settings-url-mappings.png" width="49%" />
</p>

> [!WARNING]
> Each time you run `cloudflared`, it will generate a new URL. Be sure to update your Discord Activity's "OAuth2 → Redirect URL" and "URL Mappings → Target" to the new URL.

_(Be sure to complete all the steps listed [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity) to ensure your development setup is working as expected.)_

### Using [Colyseus Cloud](https://colyseus.io/cloud-managed-hosting/)

When using Colyseus Cloud with Scalability, you must configure the following URL Mappings:

When instantiating the `Client` SDK, you should do as follows:

- `new Client('https://[subdomain].colyseus.cloud')`

---

## Deploying your Discord Activity

When deploying your Discord Activity, you will generally need to deploy the `client` and `server` projects separately, under their own public URLs.

> [!TIP]
> You can use services like Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku to deploy your client project, and services like [Colyseus Cloud](https://colyseus.io/cloud-managed-hosting/), [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/marketplace/apps/colyseus/?ref=8013231), AWS, or DigitalOcean to deploy your server project.

You will need to configure your Discord Activity's URLs:

- "OAuth2 → Redirect URL" to point to your deployed **client** project.
- "URL Mappings → Root Mapping / Target" to point to your deployed **client** project.
- "URL Mappings → Prefix `/colyseus` / Target" to point to your deployed **server** project.
