### Testing from Unity Editor

Starting with Unity 6000.1.0b1, Unity integrates [Multiplayer Play Mode](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/mppm/current/about/), enabling you to test your Colyseus-based multiplayer game with multiple clients directly within the Unity Editor, without needing to build the application.

- See how to install [Multiplayer Play Mode](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/mppm/current/install/)
- Alternatively, you can use [ParrelSync](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync) for older versions of Unity.

## Setup

Here we'll be going over the steps to get your Unity client up and running and connected to a Colyseus server.

Topics covered include:

- Running the server locally
- Server settings
- Connecting to a server
- Connecting to a room
- Communicating with a room, and the room's state.

The topics should be enough for you to set up a basic client on your own, however, you are welcome to use and modify the included example code to suit your needs.

## Running the server locally

To run the demonstration server locally, you will first need to download the Server code to your machine.  The Server code for the Unity SDK lives at https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-unity-sdk/tree/master. Download that repo, and open a terminal in the repo folder, then run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh filename="Terminal"
cd Server
npm install
npm start
```

The built-in demonstration comes with a single [room handler](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-unity3d/blob/master/Server/src/rooms/MyRoom.ts), containing a suggested way of handling entities and players. Feel free to change all of it to fit your needs!

## Initializing the `Client`

Client instance must be initalized with the server's WebSocket address/Secure websocket(wss) address in the initial stage.

```cs
ColyseusClient client = new ColyseusClient("http://localhost:2567");
```

## Connecting to a Room:

- There are several ways to create and/or join a room.
- You can create a room by calling the `Create` method of `ColyseusClient` which will automatically create an instance of the room on the server and join it:
```csharp
ColyseusRoom<MyRoomState> room = await client.Create<MyRoomState>(roomName);
```

- You can join an existing room if there is any available slot in the room by calling `join`:
```csharp
ColyseusRoom<MyRoomState> room = await client.Join<MyRoomState>(roomName);
```

- Also you can join a an available room by calling `JoinById`:
```csharp
ColyseusRoom<MyRoomState> room = await client.JoinById<MyRoomState>(roomId);
```

- You can call the `JoinOrCreate` method of `ColyseusClient` which will matchmake into an available room, if able to, or will create a new instance of the room and then join it on the server:
```csharp
ColyseusRoom<MyRoomState> room = await client.JoinOrCreate<MyRoomState>(roomName);
```

## Room Options:

- When creating a new room you have the ability to pass in a dictionary of room options, such as a minimum number of players required to start a game or the name of the custom logic file to run on your server.
- Options are of type `object` and are keyed by the type `string`:
```csharp
Dictionary<string, object> roomOptions = new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    ["YOUR_ROOM_OPTION_1"] = "option 1",
    ["YOUR_ROOM_OPTION_2"] = "option 2"
};

ColyseusRoom<MyRoomState> room = await client.JoinOrCreate<ExampleRoomState>(roomName, roomOptions);
```

## Room Events:

`ColyseusRoom` has various events that you will want to subscribe to:

### OnJoin
- Gets called after the client has successfully connected to the room.

### OnLeave

- Gets called after the client has been disconnected from the room.
- Has an `int` parameter with the reason for the disconnection.
```csharp
room.OnLeave += OnLeaveRoom;
```
where `OnLeaveRoom` functions as so:
```csharp
private void OnLeaveRoom(int code)
  {
      WebSocketCloseCode closeCode = WebSocketHelpers.ParseCloseCodeEnum(code);
      Debug.Log(string.Format("ROOM: ON LEAVE =- Reason: {0} ({1})", closeCode, code));
  }
```

### OnStateChange
- Any time the room's state changes, including the initial state, this event will get fired.

```csharp
room.OnStateChange += OnStateChangeHandler;
private static void OnStateChangeHandler(ExampleRoomState state, bool isFirstState)
{
    // Do something with the state
}
```

### OnError
- When a room related error occurs on the server it will be reported with this event.
- Has parameters for an error code and an error message.

## Room Messages:
You have the ability to listen for or to send custom messages from/to a room instance on the server.

### OnMessage
- To add a listener you call `OnMessage` passing in the type and the action to be taken when that message is received by the client.
- Messages are useful for events that occur in the room on the server. (Take a look at our [tech demos](https://docs.colyseus.io/demo/shooting-gallery/) for use case examples of using `OnMessage`)

```csharp
room.OnMessage<MyMessageType>("welcomeMessage", message =>
{
    Debug.Log(message);
});
```

### Send
- To send a custom message to the room on the server use the `Send` method of `ColyseusRoom`
- Specify the `type` and an optional `message` parameters to send to your room.

```csharp
room.Send("position", new { x = 1.3, y = -1.4 });
```

### Room State:
> See how to generate your `RoomState` from [State Sync Callbacks](/sdk/state-sync-callbacks#frontend-schema-generation)

- Each room holds its own state. The mutations of the state are synchronized automatically to all connected clients.
- In regards to room state synchronization:
  - When the user successfully joins the room, they receive the full state from the server.
  - At every `patchRate`, binary patches of the state are sent to every client (default is 50ms)
  - `onStateChange` is called on the frontend after every patch received from the server.
  - Each serialization method has its own particular way to handle incoming state patches.
- `MyRoomState` is the base room state you will want your room state to inherit from.
- Take a look at our tech demos for implementation examples of synchronizable data in a room&#39;s state such as networked entities, networked users, or room attributes. ([Shooting Gallery Tech Demo](/examples/unity/shooting-gallery))

```csharp
public partial class MyRoomState : Schema
{
	[Type(0, "map", typeof(MapSchema<Player>))]
	public MapSchema<Player> players = new MapSchema<Player>();
}
```

When you are using MapSchema or ArraySchema, the state sychronizations from the server can be used as below as well.

```csharp
var callbacks = Colyseus.Schema.Callbacks.Get(room);

// Player has been added to Schema
callbacks.OnAdd(state => state.players, (key, player) =>
{
    Debug.Log($"{key} has joined the Game!");

    // Something has changed in the Player instance
    callbacks.OnChange(player, (key, value) =>
    {
        Debug.Log($"{key} has changed!");
    });
});

// Player has been removed from Schema
callbacks.OnRemove(state => state.players, (key, player) =>
{
    Debug.Log($"{key} has left the Game!");
});
```

## Debugging

If you set a breakpoint in your application while the WebSocket connection is open, the connection will be closed automatically after 3 seconds due to inactivity. To prevent the WebSocket connection from dropping, use `pingInterval: 0` during development:

```ts filename="app.config.ts"
import { defineServer } from "colyseus";
import { WebSocketTransport } from "@colyseus/ws-transport";

const server = defineServer({
    // ...
    transport: new WebSocketTransport({
        pingInterval: 0, // <--- HERE
    }),
    // ...
});
```

Make sure to have a `pingInterval` higher than `0` on production. The default `pingInterval` value is `3000`.
