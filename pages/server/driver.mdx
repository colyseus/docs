# Driver

The driver is responsible for storing and retrieving room data for match-making.

## Overview

When a room is created, deleted, or its "metadata" is properties are updated - the driver is responsible for storing and retrieving this information.

## Available Drivers

- [Local In-Memory (default)](#local-in-memory)
- [Redis](#redis)
- [Drizzle Driver (PostgreSQL)](#drizzle-driver-postgresql)
- [MongoDB](#mongodb)

### Local In-Memory

The default driver used by Colyseus is the `LocalDriver`, which stores all room data in memory. This driver is suitable for development and small-scale single-process applications.

### Redis

The `RedisDriver` stores room data in a Redis database. This driver is suitable for large-scale multi-process applications and is recommended for production environments.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save @colyseus/redis-driver
```

```ts {2,5} filename="app.config.ts"
import { defineServer } from "colyseus";
import { RedisDriver } from "@colyseus/redis-driver";

const server = defineServer({
    driver: new RedisDriver(/* connection options */),
    // ...
});
```

### Drizzle Driver (PostgreSQL)

<Callout type="info">
    The Drizzle/PostgreSQL driver is experimental. Use at your own risk. Please report any issues you may find.
</Callout>

The `PostgresDriver` stores room data in a PostgreSQL database. This driver is suitable for large-scale multi-process applications and is recommended for production environments.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save @colyseus/drizzle-driver
```

```ts {2,5} filename="app.config.ts"
import { defineServer } from "colyseus";
import { PostgresDriver } from "@colyseus/drizzle-driver";

const server = defineServer({
    driver: new PostgresDriver(/* connection options */),
    // ...
});
```

### MongoDB

The `MongoDriver` stores room data in a MongoDB database. This driver is not actively maintained and is not recommended for production environments.

```ts {2,5} filename="app.config.ts"
import { defineServer } from "colyseus";
import { MongooseDriver } from "@colyseus/mongoose-driver";

const server = defineServer({
    driver: new MongooseDriver(/* connection options */),
    // ...
});
```
