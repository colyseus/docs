## Debug messages

To enable all debug logs, run your server using the `DEBUG=colyseus:*` environment variable:

```sh filename="Terminal"
DEBUG=colyseus:* npm start
```

## Inspector

You can use the the built-in inspector from Node.js to debug your application.

### Attaching the Node.js Inspector on a Remote Server

Be careful when using the inspector on production. Using memory snapshots and breakpoints will impact the experience of your users directly.

<Steps>
#### SSH into the Remote Server

```sh filename="Terminal (local)"
ssh root@remote.example.com
```

#### Check the PID of the Node process

```sh filename="Terminal (remote)"
ps aux | grep node
```

#### Attach the inspector on the Node.js process

The `kill` command will send the `SIGUSR1` signal to the Node.js process, which will start the inspector. It does not kill the process.

```sh filename="Terminal (remote)"
kill -usr1 PID
```

#### Create a SSH tunnel to access the inspector

From a new terminal window, create a SSH tunnel to access the inspector:

```sh filename="Terminal (local)"
ssh -L 9229:localhost:9229 root@remote.example.com
```

#### Open Chrome and access the inspector

Open Chrome and access the inspector by navigating to `chrome://inspect`. It will show the remote server as a target.
