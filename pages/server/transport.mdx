# Transport

The Transport layer is responsible for handling the low-level network communication between the Colyseus server and clients. It manages WebSocket connections, handles ping/pong heartbeats to detect disconnected clients, and provides the underlying HTTP server for the application.

## Available Transports

## Connection Lifecycle

When a client connects to the server, the transport layer:

1. Accepts the WebSocket connection
2. Starts heartbeat monitoring (ping/pong) to detect unresponsive clients
3. Parses the connection URL for `sessionId`, `roomId`, and authentication tokens
4. Forwards the connection to the appropriate room via `matchMaker`
