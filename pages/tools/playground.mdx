# Playground

The frontend playground allows to easily create connections with rooms and inspect how they communicate with the server.

## Features

- Lists all your defined room types
- Allows to `joinOrCreate` / `create` / `join` into them.
- When `joinById` is selected, provides a list of active rooms by id
- Visualize the client state in JSON format
- Table of incoming and outgoing messages
- Table of raw events from the framework
- Allow the client to send messages by type (auto-detected)

You can also interactively test how your room behaves during a dropped connection versus when a client leaves the room consensually.

## Installation

This package is installed by default on new projects created via `npm create colyseus-app`.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save @colyseus/playground
```

Then, import and bind it to your express app instance:

```ts {2,8} filename="app.config.ts"
import { defineServer } from "colyseus";
import { playground } from "@colyseus/playground";

const server = defineServer({
    // ...
    express: (app) => {
        // bind it as an express middleware
        app.use("/playground", playground());
    }
    // ...
});
```
